LiDAR is an active remote sensing system which uses pulsed laser beams to accurately map out an environment. The basic mechanism is known as “time of flight” measurement in which a laser beam is emitted towards an object, reflected off of the object and then collected in a sensor located within the LiDAR module. When the beam returns, it carries with it information about the object that it contacted including distance and optical characteristics like reflectivity.

## #100daysofcode
Almost a hundred days ago from now (01/10/2020), I decided to do the #100daysofcode challenge. This challenge is simply for someone to code every day and post on social media a picture shows that he wrote a code (every day). And than they share with us the final project.<br>
But me..! I did it differently, every day I built an app, a game, a web page or a desktop app. Every day something new and I shared all my apps simulation on my Instagram account (you can see my highlight stories), click <a href='https://instagram.com/medyanis_hiou'>here</a> if you wanna see it. And than I'll mix all my small apps in one big project. So I decided to share all projects with you.<br>
